										    <i>A Letter from the Editors</i><br>
                                                18 December, 2019 
                                        </p>
	<p style = "text-indent: 30pt;">Go into any dorm on campus. Walk down the halls. You’ll find the usual trappings of college life: conversations, music, garlic fries from late night, and even the occasional party. But meaningful conversations about local issues are much harder to come by. If politics come up, people often get together with friends from the same side of the political spectrum. Far more often, it’s easier to not discuss tense political issues at all. Campus discourse is broken.
	</p>
	<p style = "text-indent: 30pt;">
	For one thing, the link between political identity and social standing make it difficult to address challenging issues. For a student from underprivileged backgrounds, acknowledging their hardships through a public forum can layer on new trauma. Having to begin a statement about alcohol on campus by saying “My mother was an alcoholic,” or having to preface a conversation about gender by saying “I’m trans” can be difficult. But anyone would agree that if anything, these voices are even more valuable in such conversations. That’s where the option to remain anonymous comes in. We hope that by protecting the identities of marginalized people, we might make room for them to raise their voices.</p>
	<p style = "text-indent: 30pt;">
	It’s also necessary to briefly address the problem of conservatives on campus. This is not a conservative publication. In fact, in the spirit of full disclosure, we must confess that we lean to the left of the political spectrum. But we acknowledge that many campus conservatives find themselves in hiding, sneaking out in the dead of night to attend meetings of the Stanford College Republicans. Being honest about this part of their identity would be a social threat. <br></p>
    	<p  style = "text-indent: 30pt">
    Even within SCR, some conservatives hold liberal views that they feel compelled to hold from their fellow republicans for the same reason that they’re reluctant to share their political identity with the rest of the student body. In both cases, it’s not the sharing itself which can be painful, but the subsequent alienation that comes with being conservative at Stanford. In the spirit of compassion, we should aim to be more welcoming to our conservative classmates, even if we disagree with their beliefs. After all, isn’t compassionate acceptance what we all want? <br>
    </p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 30pt;">
    More pragmatically, echo chambers––liberal or conservative––only entrench beliefs and biases. Without discussion or dissent, political ideologies develop lives of their own, beyond the control of any individual who holds them. If we don’t keep each other accountable through thoughtful debate, campus discourse could spiral further out of control.<br>
    
    </p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 30pt;">
    The Office of the Dean of Undergraduates has made a commitment to inclusivity and community on campus. This is a venerable goal, and we believe that we can help to fulfill it. If students have a place where they feel comfortable expressing their views without social pressure, Stanford might feel a bit more like home. For that reason, we’ve created the Stanford Verum, a forum where students can share their thoughtful comments and debate on important campus issues in a highly local forum.<br>
